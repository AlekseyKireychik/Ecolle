            <p>
                <em>These Terms and Conditions were last updated on 12th of March, 2020</em>
            </p>
            <p>Please read these Terms and Conditions (“Terms”) carefully before using the services at https://uileads.com (“the Service”) operated by UI Leads (“us”, “we”, or “our”). These Terms sets forth the legally binding terms and conditions and constitutes the entire agreement between you and UI Leads for your use of the Service. The term “you” shall also include your employees or other authorized users to the extent applicable and permitted under your subscription of the Service. 
By accessing or using the Service in any manner, including, but not limited to, visiting or browsing the Service, subscribing to automated emails or contributing content or other materials to the Service, you agree to be bound by these Terms (“Agreement”). Capitalized terms are defined in these Terms. </p>
            <span>1. The Service</span>
            <p>The Service is a lead generation tool. We reserve the right to modify, discontinue, and restrict, temporarily or permanently, all or part of the Service without notice at our sole discretion. Neither we nor our suppliers or licensors will be liable to you or to any third party for any modification, discontinuance, or restriction of the Service. We might, at our sole discretion and from time to time, offer you free trials of the Service or selected features of the Service for a limited time period. Once the free trial period ends, your access to such trial features terminates.</p>
            <span>2. Eligibility </span>
            <p>The Service is not intended for users that are consumers (being an individual acting primarily for purposes other than a trade, business or profession) and the applicability of consumer protection legislation is therefore excluded. You must be 18 years of age or older to enter into this agreement and use the Service. You represent and warrant that any information you submit is true and accurate and that you are 18 years of age or older and are fully able and competent to enter into and abide by these Terms. </p>
            <span>3. Account Registration </span>
            <p>You must register to use certain features of the Service. When you register, you agree to (a) provide accurate, current and complete information about you as may be prompted by registration forms on the Service (“Registration Data”); (b) maintain the security of any logins, passwords, or other credentials that you select or that are provided to you for use on the Service; (c) maintain and promptly update the Registration Data, and any other information you provide to us, and to keep all such information accurate, current, and complete; and (d) notify us immediately of any unauthorized use of your account or any other breach of security by emailing us at <a href="mailto:support@uileads.com">support@uileads.com</a>. </p>
            <span>4. Fees and Payment </span>
            <p>We will charge fees for use of certain features of the Services, either on a one-time- or subscription basis (“Paid Services”). UI Leads reserves the right to implement fees or change the fees for the Service at any time by providing you notice on the Service or otherwise. 

                <br/>Fees shall be paid in accordance to the prices offered on our website in force from time to time. Prices for the Paid Services may vary depending on the billing period, volume of the unique leads or similar factor determined by us and set forth on our website. All prices on our website are exclusive of any value-added taxes. Paid Services may be purchased with a credit card. 
                
                <br/>When you purchase any Paid Services with a credit card, you authorize UI Leads or its third party payment processors to charge the credit card identified by you (which you represent and warrant that you are authorized to use) all applicable fees for your purchase, including all applicable taxes, and you agree that our payment provider can store your credit card information. 
                
                <br/>If UI Leads does not receive payment from you or your credit card provider, you agree to pay all amounts due upon demand and UI Leads may suspend your access to the Service until full payment is received or terminate the Service. All sales are final and UI Leads will not issue refunds, including for prepaid periodical fees. If you choose an automatic recurring payment and later decide to end your subscription, cancelling the payment is your responsibility. UI Leads does not refund automatic payments not cancelled in time. </p>
